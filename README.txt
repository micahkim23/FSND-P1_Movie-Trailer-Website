This is the README file for the movie website project.

In order to open the file, just click on the fresh_tomatoes.html document and open it with the google chrome browser.

If you would like to make changes to the website with your own movie choice, you can create a new Movie object with its name, storyline, image, and trailer url in the entertainment.py file. Then run
entertainment.py in python idle to make sure the website is updated.
